               <p id="para1"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth</p>
               <p id="des1">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
I enrolled shortly thereafter.
The next 12 weeks was the best and most grueling  time of my life.
Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <p id="para3">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
        <p id="des3">“Before joining the bootcamp, I had never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who could help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way no tutorial could ever have. I often refer to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!”</p>

<p id="para5">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
        
<p id="des5">“The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.”</p>
